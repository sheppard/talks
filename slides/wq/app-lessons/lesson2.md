Use of applicationCache does not guarantee your browser (or an intermediate server) won't try to use traditional caching as well

```javascript
Document was loaded from Application Cache 
    with manifest http://cred.wq.io/cred.appcache
Application Cache Checking event
Application Cache NoUpdate event
```
